      <p>The series revolves around four older, single women (three widows and one divorcée) sharing a
        house in Miami, Florida. The owner of the house is a widow named Blanche Devereaux (Rue McClanahan),
        who was joined by fellow widow Rose Nylund (Betty White) and divorcée Dorothy Zbornak (Bea Arthur).
        They both responded to a room-for-rent ad on the bulletin board of a local grocery store.
        In the pilot episode, the women had a gay cook named Coco (Charles Levin), who was subsequently
        removed.[5] The three were soon joined by Dorothy's mother, Sophia Petrillo (Estelle Getty),
        after the retirement home where she lived, Shady Pines, burned down.</p>
